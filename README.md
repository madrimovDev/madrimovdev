# ⌨️ Yo, I’m <strong>Madrimov</strong> — a terminal-born, vinyl-era code wrangler

⚡ Coded my first loop when floppy disks were cool. <br />
📽️ Still think inline styles are a sin. <br />
⌛ If it ain’t in the terminal, it ain’t real.

## 🛠 Tech Stack — *"From the days of dial-up to dark mode"*

### 🧬 Core Web Tech
- HTML5 / CSS3 / JS (ES6+), TypeScript  

### 🎭 Styling (a.k.a. "The Fine Art of Front-End")
- Sass, Less, Tailwind, Bootstrap, Bulma, Materialize

### ⚛️ Frameworks (and the beasts I've tamed)
- React.js ⚛  
- State Management: Redux, MobX, Zustand, Context API, and my own stubbornness
- UI Libraries: Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI
- Animations: Framer Motion, GSAP (a.k.a. "pixel choreography")

### 🧰 Workflows (Old-School DevOps, Baby)
- Git + GitHub (I still commit like it's 1999)
- npm / Yarn (dependency hell's loyal companions)
- Vite, Webpack, Parcel (because builds used to take **hours**, kid)
- ESLint, Prettier (keeping code cleaner than my keyboard)
- Deployments? Manual FTP uploads? Been there. Now on Vercel & Netlify.
